# Spiritual AI Task Manager

An AI-driven supportive system integrating spiritual insights from consciousness research and Bahá'’ principles with gentle task management for individuals with C-PTSD and other stress conditions.

## Spiritual Framework

Based on Donald Hoffman's consciousness research and Bahá'í principles:

- **You are not your struggles**: Your current challenges are experiences of your avatar, not your essential self
- **Reality as construct**: What we perceive is a user interface, not absolute reality
- **Unconditional love**: Starting with self-compassion and gentleness
- **You are already enough**: No performance or achievement required to prove worth 
- **Spiritual silence**: Finding peace in stillness and being

## System Principles

1. **Task Chunking**: Break every goal into 3-7 actionable steps (15-30 minutes each)
2. **User Agency**: You choose the pace and next steps, AI suggests options
3. **One Step Active**: Never have more than one task "live" at a time
4. **Gentle Overwhelm Handling**: Always offer breakdown, skip, or reorder options
5. **No-Stimulation Reminders**: Neutral, non-pushy approach
6. **Spiritual Anchoring**: Optional check-ins with faith insights

## Philosophy

"When you feel caged or hopeless, remember that what you're experiencing is just a limited headset and not the whole picture. You are a unique angle of the Infinite, exploring reality through this body and mind. Love – starting with gentleness toward yourself, is the most reliable and freeing truth."
